# Module 9 Challenge

## Description
This challenge was intended to test our skills in using the NPM Inquirer package.  We were required to use the inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions intended to help them generate a markdown document.  This was an interestong challenge as it was a new process for me making a walk-through video.  Overaell, I enjoyed this challenge.

## Installation
User should install all the dependencies required to run this application by entering the command "npm install" in their command line.  After dependencies are installed, the user can run the application with the command, "node index.js" entered in a terminal opened from the "Develop" folder.
