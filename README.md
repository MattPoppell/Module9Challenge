# Module 9 Challenge

## Description
This challenge was intended to test our skills in using the NPM Inquirer package.  We were required to use the inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions intended to help them generate a markdown document.  This was an interestong challenge as it was a new process for me making a walk-through video.  Overaell, I enjoyed this challenge.
